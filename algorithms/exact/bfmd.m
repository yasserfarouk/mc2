%
% Inputs:
% =======
% lengths = if scalar --> motif length
%     if a vector --> motif discovery is applied at all lengths in this
%     vector (e.g. [2:2:10] will apply bruteForce to lengths 2,4,6,8,10)
% innerOverlap = Maximum overlap allowed between occurrences in the same
%                motif. Window of Exclusion is calculated as: 
%                (1-innerOverlap)*LENGTH. The algorithm does not calculate 
%                distances between any pairs that start less than W points 
%                apart (default 0.0 allowing no overlap).
% nMotifs =  [Optional] number of motifs to discover. (default 1)
% outerOverlap = [Optional] fraction of overlap allowed between different
%               motifs (default 0.0=no overlap)
% doNormalize = [Optional] if nonzero the data is normalized by subtacting mean and
%               dividing by std deviation (default 1)
% F =        [Optional] if nonzero then only the maximum not max K motifs are kept during
%           first stage of references (default 1)

% Outputs:
% ========
% locs      a m*1 cell array representing the locations of m motifs in the
%           time series. each element of the cell-array contains a n_i*2
%           array representing the beginning and end of one occurrence of
%           the motif
% means     The means of the motifs found as a m*1 cell array each with a
%           mean of one motif
% stats     the statistics of each motif in the form of a structure array.
%           members:
%               mean    The mean difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%               var     The standard deviation difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%               max     The maximum difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%               min     The minimum difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%               median  The mmedian difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%               mode    The mode of the difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%
% maxSmallDistance  The Euclidean distance between the two occurrences of 
%                   the last motif found
% success   nonzero if the function succeeded. if it fails (due to a
%           problem with mk++.exe) it returns zero

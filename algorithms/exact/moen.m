function [locs,dists,executionTime,means,stats]=moen(x,lrange,lStep,normalization,innerOverlap ...
                        ,nMotifs,outerOverlap)
% applies the MOEN algorithm using moen.exe 
% Inputs:
% =======
% x         The input time series
% lrange    The minimum and maximum expected lengths of motifs. If a
%           single number is passed it is treated as the maximum 
% lStep     The number of points to add from the lowest to highest motif lengths.
%           if not given then it is assumed min(10,(maxLength-minLength)/10)
% normalization  [Optional] The normalization method used:
%            0  NO normalization
%            1  subtract the mean
%            2  subtract the mean and divide by the range 
%            3  zscore (subtract the mean and divide by the standard
%               deviation)            (default)
% innerOverlap = [Optional] Maximum overlap allowed between occurrences in the same
%                motif. Window of Exclusion is calculated as: 
%                (1-innerOverlap)*LENGTH. The algorithm does not calculate 
%                distances between any pairs that start less than W points 
%                apart (default 0.0 allowing no overlap).
% R = [Optional] number of reference points (default 8)
% nMotifs =  [Optional] number of motifs to discover. (default 10)
% outerOverlap = [Optional] fraction of overlap allowed between different
%               motifs (default 0.0=no overlap)
% recalcDists = [Optional] if nonzero the distances to reference points are
%            calculated everytime we increase length (default 0=false)
% approximate = [OPTIONAL] if nonzero then an approximate solution will be
%               used assuming that the distance does not decrease with
%               increased length. This is exact in cases of normalization<2
%               and in most cases when normalization==2 but is a very bad
%               approximation when normlaization==3 (default 0)
% earlyAbandon = [Optional] if nonzero early abandonment is used during
%               scanning. It should always be set to 1 (default 1)
%
% Outputs:
% ========
% locs      a m*1 cell array representing the locations of m motifs in the
%           time series. each element of the cell-array contains a n_i*2
%           array representing the beginning and end of one occurrence of
%           the motif
% means     The means of the motifs found as a m*1 cell array each with a
%           mean of one motif
% stats     the statistics of each motif in the form of a structure array.
%           members:
%               mean    The mean difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%               var     The standard deviation difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%               max     The maximum difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%               min     The minimum difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%               median  The mmedian difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%               mode    The mode of the difference between corresponding
%                           points in the occurrences
%
% maxSmallDistance  The Euclidean distance between the two occurrences of 
%                   the last motif found
% success   nonzero if the function succeeded. if it fails (due to a
%           problem with mk++.exe) it returns zero
